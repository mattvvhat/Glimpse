# Glimpse

Object-oriented controller for handling cross-browser tricks based around focus
and blur. This allows for easy implementation and management of their
event-handlers, a simple include script via bower/component, and an easy method
to handle parents or their children being focused. This was originally used for
analytics and page-swapping. Sneaky.
